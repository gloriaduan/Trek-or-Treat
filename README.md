## About the Project
Trek Or Treat is a personal project inspired by wanting to make trick-or-treating easier and more convinient in my community. During Halloween in my community, the decorated halloween houses that offer trick-or-treating is very sparse which prompted the creation of this web application that allows people to post their decorated houses on a map and users will be able to select destinations and create a trick-or-treating route. 

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality powered by Clerk, ensuring only authenticated users can create or save content.
- **Location Posting**: Add decorated Halloween house locations to the map to make it easier for others to find and visit during trick-or-treating.
- **Interactive Map with Mapbox**: Explore a map populated with Halloween house locations, visually engaging and user-friendly.
- **Route Planning**: Select destinations on the map and generate optimized trick-or-treating routes using Mapbox's routing capabilities.
- **Save Routes**: Save your planned routes for convenient access later.

### Built With
- **FullStack**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **Third-party APIs**: Mapbox
- **Authentication**: Clerk

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
